Line 17: Incorrect closing tag; should be </html>.
Line 2: The <head> tag should be followed by <body>, indicating proper structure.
Line 3: A proper comment block must use the <!-- --> format instead of being placed incorrectly in the body.
Line 9: The <div> element is improperly structured without a closing tag.
