    <h3 id="Etymology">Etymology:</h3>
    <p>The Old English tigras derives from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris, which was a borrowing from Classical Greek τίγρις 'tigris'.[4] Since ancient times, the word tigris has been suggested to originate from the Armenian or Persian word for 'arrow', which may also be the origin of the name for the river Tigris.[5][6] However, today, the names are thought to be homonyms, and the connection between the tiger and the river is doubted.[6]</p>

    <h3 id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy:</h3>
    <p>In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris, as the genus Felis was being used for all cats at the time. His scientific description was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi.[2] In 1929, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the species in the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris.[7][8] Nine recent tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early 19th and early 21st centuries, namely the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali and Sumatran tigers.[9][10] The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999 as most putative subspecies were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural history museum collections that are not necessarily representative for the entire population. It was proposed to recognise only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia and the smaller P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.[11] This two-subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in 2015 through a comprehensive analysis of morphological, ecological and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) traits of all putative tiger subspecies.[10] In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy in accordance with the 2015 two-subspecies proposal and recognised only P. t. tigris and P. t. sondaica.[12] Results of a 2018 whole-genome sequencing study of 32 samples from the six living putative subspecies—the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian and Sumatran tiger—found them to be distinct and separate clades.[13] These results were corroborated in 2021 and 2023.[14][15] The Cat Specialist Group states that "Given the varied interpretations of data, the [subspecific] taxonomy of this species is currently under review by the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group."[16]</p>

    <h3 id="Characteristics">Characteristics:</h3>
    <p>The tiger has a typical felid morphology, with a muscular body, shortened legs, strong forelimbs with wide front paws, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of the rest of its body.[47][48] It has five digits, including a dewclaw, on the front feet and four on the back, all of which have retractile claws that are compact and curved, and can reach 10 cm (3.9 in) long.[47][49] The ears are rounded and the eyes have a round pupil.</p>

    <h3 id="DistributionAndHabitat">Distribution and Habitat:</h3>
    <p>The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey, northern Iran and Afghanistan to Central Asia and from northern Pakistan through the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to southeastern Siberia, Sumatra, Java and Bali.[47] As of 2022, it inhabits less than 7% of its historical distribution and has a scattered range in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra, northeastern China and the Russian Far East.[1] As of 2020, India had the largest extent of global tiger habitat with 300,508 km2 (116,027 sq mi), followed by Russia with 195,819 km2 (75,606 sq mi).[65]</p>

    <h3 id="BehaviorAndEcology">Behavior and Ecology:</h3>
    <p>Camera trap data show that tigers in Chitwan National Park avoided locations frequented by people and were more active at night than during day.[78] In Sundarbans National Park, six radio-collared tigers were most active from dawn to early morning and reached their zenith around 7:00 o'clock in the morning.[79] A three-year-long camera trap survey in Shuklaphanta National Park revealed that tigers were most active from dusk until midnight.[80] In northeastern China, tigers were crepuscular and active at night with activity peaking at dawn and dusk; they were largely active at the same time as their prey.[81]</p>

    <h3 id="Communication">Communication:</h3>
    <p>During friendly encounters and bonding, tigers rub against each other's bodies.[97] Facial expressions include the "defence threat", which involves a wrinkled face, bared teeth, pulled-back ears and widened pupils.[98][47] Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic curled-lip grimace, when smelling urine markings. Males also use the flehmen to detect the markings made by tigresses in oestrus.[47] Tigers will move their ears around to display the white spots, particularly during aggressive encounters and between mothers and cubs.[99] They also use their tails to signal their mood. To show cordiality, the tail sticks up and sways slowly, while an apprehensive tiger lowers its tail or wags it side-to-side. When calm, the tail hangs low.[100]</p>

    <h3 id="HuntingAndDiet">Hunting and Diet:</h3>
    <p>The tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator feeding mainly on large and medium-sized ungulates, with a preference for sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha, gaur and wild boar.[109][110][111] Abundance and body weight of prey species are assumed to be the main criteria for the tiger's prey selection, both inside and outside protected areas.[112] It also preys opportunistically on smaller species like monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, porcupines and fish.[47][57] Occasional attacks on Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceroses have also been reported.[113] More often, tigers take the more vulnerable calves.[114] They sometimes prey on livestock and dogs in close proximity to settlements.[47] Tigers occasionally consume vegetation, fruit and minerals for dietary fibre and supplements.[115] </p>

    <h3 id="Conservation">Conservation:</h3>
    <p>Internationally, the tiger is protected under CITES Appendix I, banning trade of live tigers and their body parts.[1] In Russia, hunting the tiger has been banned since 1952.[199] In Bhutan, it has been protected since 1969 and enlisted as totally protected since 1995.[200] Since 1972, it has been afforded the highest protection level under India's Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.[201] In Nepal and Bangladesh, it has been protected since 1973.[201][187] Since 1976, it has been totally protected under Malaysia's Protection of Wild Life Act,[202] and the country's Wildlife Conservation Act enacted in 2010 increased punishments for wildlife-related crimes.[196] In Indonesia, it has been protected since 1990.[203] In China, the trade in tiger body parts was banned in 1993.[204] The Thai Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act was enacted in 2019 to combat poaching and trading of body parts.</p>

    <h3 id="Relationshipwithhumans"> Relationship with humans:</h3>
    <p>Tigers have been kept in captivity since ancient times. In ancient Rome, tigers were displayed in amphitheatres; they were slaughtered in venatio hunts and used to kill criminals.[235] The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan is reported to have kept tigers in the 13th century. Starting in the Middle Ages, tigers were being kept in European menageries.[236] Tigers and other exotic animals were mainly used for the entertainment of elites but from the 19th century onward, they were exhibited more to the public. Tigers were particularly big attractions and their captive population soared.[237] In 2020, there were over 8,000 captive tigers in Asia, over 5,000 in the US and no less than 850 in Europe.[238] There are more tigers in captivity than in the wild.[222] Captive tigers may display stereotypical behaviours such as pacing or inactivity. Modern zoos are able to reduce such behaviours with exhibits designed so the animals can move between separate but connected enclosures.[239] Enrichment items are also important for the cat's welfare and the stimulation of its natural behaviours.[240] </p>

    <h3 id="Hunting"> Hunting:</h3>
    <p>Tigers have been hunted by humans for millennia, as indicated by a painting on the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India that is dated to 5,000–6,000 years ago. They were hunted throughout their range in Asia, chased on horseback, elephant-back or even with sled dogs and killed with spears and later firearms. Such hunts were conducted both by native governments and empires like the Mughal Empire, as well as European colonists. Tigers were often hunted as trophies and because of their perceived danger.[223] An estimated 80,000 tigers were killed between 1875 and 1925. </p>

    <h3 id="Attacks"> Attacks:</h3>
    <p>In most areas, tigers avoid humans, but attacks are a risk wherever people coexist with them.[226][227] Dangerous encounters are more likely to occur in edge habitats between wild and agricultural areas.[226] Most attacks on humans are defensive, including protection of young; however, tigers do sometimes see people as prey.[227] Man-eating tigers tend to be old and disabled.[57] Tigers driven from their home ranges are also at risk of turning to man-eating. </p>
